===== Button Debouncing =====

Certain care is necessary when using buttons for control.  One wishes to capture only the single push of a button and not multiple presses.  This can be controlled by the use of while statements such as these from the boost gauge function:
{{{
  while (digitalRead(buttonBpin) == HIGH){
     //wait for timing T2
     if (digitalRead(buttonApin) == LOW){
      return;
     }
  ...
}}}
